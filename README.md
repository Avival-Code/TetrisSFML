# TetrisSFML
Tetris game made using SFML

This marks the third item I personally make from scratch. The end result was satisfying. I'd like to consider this little game to be the first fully working/not so bad looking game I make.

********* These projects are basically for me to practice my C++ and just gain experience making larger things. Feel free to peruse my stuff and pm me if you have any questions. ***********
